## Overview

Curious Shulker Boxes is a mod that uses the Curios API to add a new slot, the Back slot, to the player inventory and allows the shulker boxes to be placed into this slot, either directly or through right-clicking with the box held in hand. While a shulker box is in this slot, the player can use a keybinding, default 'R', to directly access its contents. This allows the player to interact with a shulker box's contents more freely and easily without the need to place it down, to sacrifice an inventory slot to keep it around, or to need to search through a player's inventory for the box.
